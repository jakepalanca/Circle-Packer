## Introduction

**BubbleChart** is a JavaFX-based application that visualizes data through interactive bubble charts. It employs a circle packing algorithm to optimize the placement and sizing of bubbles based on their relative `radiusRatio`, ensuring a clutter-free and visually appealing representation. The application is designed for both internal testing and real-world usage, allowing developers to integrate the packing functionality into other projects seamlessly.

## Features

- **Dynamic Bubble Packing:** Optimizes the placement and sizing of bubbles to minimize overlaps based on `radiusRatio`.
- **Interactive UI:** Add, remove, and manage bubbles with ease through an intuitive JavaFX interface.
- **Customizable Chart Dimensions:** Specify the dimensions of the chart to suit various display requirements.
- **Edge Case Handling:** Predefined edge cases for testing, including single bubble, multiple identical bubbles, and random ratios.
- **UUID Integration:** Each bubble is assigned a unique identifier for precise management and removal.
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Includes JUnit tests covering various scenarios to ensure reliability.
- **Easy Integration:** Designed to be easily integrated into other Java projects as a packable module.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher:** Ensure that Java is installed on your system. You can download it from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/) or [Oracle](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html).
- **Apache Maven:** A build automation tool used for managing the project. Download it from [Maven Official Website](https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi).

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/BubbleChart.git
cd BubbleChart
```

*Replace `yourusername` with your actual GitHub username.*

## Usage

### Running the Application

1. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd BubbleChart
   ```

2. **Build the Project:**

   Use Maven to compile the project and resolve dependencies.

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

3. **Run the Application:**

   Execute the JavaFX application using Maven.

   ```bash
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

   *Alternatively, you can run the application from your IDE by running the `CirclePackingTesterApp` class.*

### Integrating into Other Projects

**BubbleChart** is designed to be easily integrated into other Java projects. Follow the steps below to incorporate its packing functionality.

1. **Add as a Dependency:**

   If you've published **BubbleChart** to a Maven repository, add the dependency to your project's `pom.xml`:

   ```xml
   <dependency>
       <groupId>com.yourcompany</groupId>
       <artifactId>BubbleChart</artifactId>
       <version>1.0.0</version>
   </dependency>
   ```

   *Replace `com.yourcompany` and other fields with your actual group ID, artifact ID, and version.*

2. **Using the `Chart` Class:**

   ```java
   import jakepalanca.bubblechart.Chart;
   import jakepalanca.bubblechart.Packable;
   import jakepalanca.bubblechart.PackingResult;

   import java.util.UUID;

   public class YourClass {
       public static void main(String[] args) {
           // Initialize the chart with desired dimensions
           Chart chart = new Chart(800, 600);

           // Create and add packable objects
           Packable bubble1 = new YourPackableImplementation(1.0);
           Packable bubble2 = new YourPackableImplementation(0.5);
           // Add more bubbles as needed

           chart.addPackable(bubble1);
           chart.addPackable(bubble2);
           // Add more bubbles as needed

           // Optimize the chart
           PackingResult<Packable> result = chart.optimize(1000);

           // Retrieve optimized packables
           for (Packable p : result.getPackables()) {
               System.out.println("Bubble ID: " + p.getId());
               System.out.println("Position: (" + p.getX() + ", " + p.getY() + ")");
               System.out.println("Radius: " + p.getRadius());
           }
       }
   }
   ```

   *Ensure that `YourPackableImplementation` implements the `Packable` interface.*

## Building and Testing

### Prerequisites

- **Java Development Kit (JDK) 11 or higher**
- **Apache Maven**

### Building with Maven

1. **Clean and Build the Project:**

   ```bash
   mvn clean install
   ```

   This command will compile the project, run tests, and package the application.

2. **Package the Application:**

   To create a JAR file:

   ```bash
   mvn package
   ```

   The JAR file will be located in the `target` directory.

### Running Tests

**BubbleChart** includes comprehensive JUnit tests to ensure the reliability of the packing algorithm.

1. **Execute Tests:**

   ```bash
   mvn test
   ```

2. **Viewing Test Reports:**

   After running tests, Maven generates reports located in the `target/surefire-reports` directory. You can review these reports for detailed information on test executions.

## JavaFX Integration

**BubbleChart** leverages JavaFX for its graphical user interface. Integrating JavaFX with Maven requires specific configurations.

### Setting Up JavaFX with Maven

1. **Add JavaFX Dependencies:**

   Ensure that your `pom.xml` includes the necessary JavaFX dependencies. Here's an example configuration:

   ```xml
   <dependencies>
       <!-- JavaFX Dependencies -->
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
           <artifactId>javafx-controls</artifactId>
           <version>20.0.1</version>
       </dependency>
       <dependency>
           <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
           <artifactId>javafx-fxml</artifactId>
           <version>20.0.1</version>
       </dependency>
       <!-- Add other JavaFX modules as needed -->
   </dependencies>

   <build>
       <plugins>
           <plugin>
               <groupId>org.openjfx</groupId>
               <artifactId>javafx-maven-plugin</artifactId>
               <version>0.0.8</version>
               <configuration>
                   <mainClass>jakepalanca.bubblechart.CirclePackingTesterApp</mainClass>
               </configuration>
           </plugin>
       </plugins>
   </build>
   ```

   *Replace the version numbers with the latest stable releases.*

2. **Running JavaFX Application with Maven:**

   Use the JavaFX Maven plugin to run the application:

   ```bash
   mvn javafx:run
   ```

   This command will launch the JavaFX application defined by the `mainClass` in the plugin configuration.

### Configuring JavaFX in Your IDE

Most modern IDEs like IntelliJ IDEA and Eclipse can automatically detect and configure JavaFX projects. Ensure that your IDE is set up to recognize the Maven project and its dependencies.
